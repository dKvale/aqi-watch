# aqi-watch

The AQI watcher monitors the state of Minnesota and nearby states for elevated AQI values due to the pollutants PM2.5, PM10, and ozone. Monitoring sites reporting a _1-hr AQI_ value above 85 are posted online at http://dkvale.github.io/aqi-watch.  Github users who are 'Watching' the issue list will receive an e-mail alert when a monitoring site crosses the threshold.
